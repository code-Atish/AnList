# AniLib

AniLib is a web application dedicated to tracking and exploring a vast collection of anime titles. You can access the deployed version of the application [here](https://anilib.vercel.app/).

Access a rich database of anime titles, complete with detailed information such as synopsis, genres, release dates, and more.
Utilize advanced search and filtering options to find anime based on genres, release years, popularity, and other criteria. AniLib seamlessly integrates with the Anilist API to fetch accurate and up-to-date data, ensuring a reliable source for anime information.

The project harnesses the power of GraphQL, a query language for APIs, to efficiently retrieve data from the Anilist API. This enhances the overall performance and responsiveness of the application.

 Built with React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, and utilizing Redux Toolkit for state management, AniLib ensures a smooth and efficient user experience.
